This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Question 1

# Matrix 1 input
matr1 = matrix(c(7,9,12,2,4,13), nrow=2, ncol=3 ,byrow=TRUE)

#Matrix 2 input
matr2 = matrix(c(1,7,12,19,2,8,13,20,3,9,14,21) , nrow=3 ,ncol=4 ,byrow = TRUE)

#printing matrix as a sanity check
print("First Matrix")
print(matr1)
print("Second Matrix")
print(matr2)


#Multiplyiing matrices
result <- matr1 %*% matr2


#Printing final result
print("Resulting Matrix")
print(result)
```


```{r}
#Question 2

#Reading in Data
data <- read.csv("Amazon.csv")

data$Total.charged = as.numeric(gsub("\\$", "", data$Total.charged))

print("total spent on amazon in period =")
print(sum(data$Total.charged))
print("average order spent on amazon in period =")
print(mean(data$Total.charged))
print("Most Expensive order spent on amazon in period =")
print(max(data$Total.charged))

# Grouping data by month in order to plot monthly spending

#Setting date as datetime variable not string
data$Order.Date = as.Date(data$Order.Date, "%m/%d/%Y")


# summing and grouping expense by month
monthlyspend <- aggregate(cbind(Total.charged)~month(data$Order.Date),
                     data=data,FUN=sum)

#Plotting
barplot(monthlyspend$Total.charged, names.arg = monthlyspend$`month(data$Order.Date)`)



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
